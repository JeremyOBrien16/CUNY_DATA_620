As an additional constraint, there should be at least one categorical variable available for each node (such as “Male” or “Female”; “Republican”, “Democrat,” or “Undecided”, etc.)"

    "[Foursquare (4S)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foursquare_(company) is a contextual location data company founded in 2009 which owns a number of [apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foursquare_City_Guide) and services.  It offers location search and social networking to users, enables location services for business partners, and sells location data to advertisers and marketers.  It is a major player who has drive consolidation in the locationm data space, and acquired Placed in 2019 and merged with Factual several months ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "4S's dataset reveals connections between venues and the users who visit them.  The company began collecting venue visitation data through user check-ins (encouraged through gamification and social networking), however, for the last decade it has leveraged passive location detection.  It further enriches the venue-visitation data it collects with user ratings and reviews.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Considered at the user population level (to preserve individual user locational privacy), 4S' data can reveal aggregated user movement patterns between venues as directed graphs with visit volume as edge weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considered at the individual venue level, the data can reveal information about and relationships between nodes.  This can include venue categories and other attributes, connections (i.e. what is the next venue visited after a given venue), and traversal direction (with edge weights defined by sequentail user visits).\n",
    "\n",
    "Foursquare exposes data via its [Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/).  Up to 950 daily API calls are permitted for free with a developer account (also free) and without implemeting User Auth.  Potentially valuable [endpoints](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/endpoints/) include venue categories, similar venues, and next venues."
