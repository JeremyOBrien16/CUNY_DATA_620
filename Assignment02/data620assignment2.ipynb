    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Network Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "[Foursquare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foursquare_(company)) (4S) is a contextual location data company founded in 2009 which owns a number of [apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foursquare_City_Guide) and services.  It offers location search and social networking to users, enables location services for business partners, and sells location data to advertisers and marketers.  It is a major player who has drive consolidation in the locationm data space, acquiring rivals [Placed](https://www.placed.com/) in 2019 and merging with [Factual](https://www.factual.com/) (previously owned by Snap) several months ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "4S's dataset can chart connections between venues and the users who visit them.  The company began collecting venue visitation data through user check-ins (encouraged through gamification and social networking), however, for the last decade it has leveraged passive location detection.  It further enriches venue-visitation data with user ratings and reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Applications for Network Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Considered at the user population level (to preserve individual user locational privacy), 4S' data can reveal aggregated user movement patterns between venues as directed graphs with visit volume as edge weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considered at the individual venue level, the data can reveal information about and relationships between nodes.  This can include venue categories and other attributes, connections (i.e. what is the next venue visited after a given venue), and traversal direction (with edge weights defined by sequentail user visits).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API\n",
    "\n",
    "Foursquare exposes data via its [Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/).  Up to 950 daily API calls are permitted for free with a developer account (also free) and without implemeting User Auth.  Potentially valuable [endpoints](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/endpoints/) include venue categories, similar venues, and next venues."

    "#### Data Extraction Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The **API call** will be designed to:\n",
    "- Walk a **directed graph** comprised of **nodes** which represent **venues**;\n",
    "- Linked by **edges** identifying which **venues** are most often **visited next**;\n",
    "- Along with the **venue categories** assigned to each node;\n",
    "- For given **seed nodes** that are **multiple POIs** (places of interest) in NYC;\n",
    "- Limited by a **designated depth** (which we'll trial); and\n",
    "- A **geographic constraint** (likely the five boroughs).\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to write the data returned to a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Network Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compose the graph using **NetworkX**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to compute the following metrics for the resulting network:\n",
    "- *Outbound degree centrality*: shows how connected the venue is to others\n",
    "- *Closeness centrality*: indicates proximity of different venues to one another, locating them in the network's core or periphery\n",
    "- *Betweenness centrality*: reflects visit throughput in the flow to next venues\n",
    "- *Eigenvector centrality*: ranks venues based on how connected their neighbor venues are to other venues"

    "- Identify popular itineraries so others can emulate or avoid them\n",
    "- Discern hubs that serve as important waypoints on itineraries\n",
