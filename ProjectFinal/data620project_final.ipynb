    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A powerful analytical application of NLP is topic modeling, which identifies the themes present in a corpus comprised of multiple documents based on the words in those documents. Because it can be used to uncover the thematic structure in documents, topic modeling has an array of applications in information retrieval and document mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics are 'probability distributions over a fixed vocabulary' 'An overview of topic modeling and its current applications in bioinformatics', and it's common to use probabilistic generative models derived from LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to model in an unsupervised fashion the latent semantic structure of documents. Topic models can be tuned and optimized in a variety of ways, including improving how topics are segregated from each other and calibrating for a useful number of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "We will combine techniques from topic modeling and network analysis to address this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a text corpus comprised of multiple documents, what are the topics of those documents and how are the documents thematically related to one another?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "- Leverage the Reuters news corpus of nearly 11,000 articles (labeled with at least one category each; unfortunately, authorship is not labeled)\n",
    "- Using the NLTK, Spacy, and Gensim packages, implement and tune an unsupervised LDA-based topic model (i.e. without reference to the provided article topic labels)\n",
    "- Analyze model perplexity and coherence, overall topic prevalence, and topic distribution across articles\n",
    "- Generate a bipartite, weighted (likely on coherence) graph of articles and topics, and analyze its topology to identify relationships between topics"
