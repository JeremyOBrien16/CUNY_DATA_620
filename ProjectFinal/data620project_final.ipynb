    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A powerful analytical application of NLP is topic modeling, which identifies the themes present in a corpus comprised of multiple documents based on the words in those documents. Because it can be used to uncover the thematic structure in documents, topic modeling has an array of applications in information retrieval and document mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics are 'probability distributions over a fixed vocabulary'. An overview of topic modeling and its current applications in bioinformatics, and it's common to use probabilistic generative models derived from LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to model in an unsupervised fashion the latent semantic structure of documents. Topic models can be tuned and optimized in a variety of ways, including improving how topics are segregated from each other and calibrating for a useful number of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "We will combine techniques from topic modeling and network analysis to address this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Given a text corpus comprised of multiple documents, what are the topics of those documents and how are the documents thematically related to one another?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "- Leverage the Reuters news corpus of nearly 11,000 articles (labeled with at least one category each; unfortunately, authorship is not labeled)\n",
    "- Using the NLTK, Spacy, and Gensim packages, implement and tune an unsupervised LDA-based topic model (i.e. without reference to the provided article topic labels)\n",
    "- Analyze model perplexity and coherence, overall topic prevalence, and topic distribution across articles\n",
    "- Generate a bipartite, weighted (on likelyhood of belonging to the most domiant topic) graph of articles and topics, and analyze its topology to identify relationships between topics "

    "We generate a topic model for the article.  We employ two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gensim's built-in LDA topic modeling function, `ldamodel`.  Gensim implementations of LDA employ Variational Inference, which introduces bias and can provide less coherence in topics.\n",
    "2. MALLET (MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit)'s LDA topic model with a Gensim wrapper, `ldamallet`.  This model employs Gibbs sampling (an MCMC method), which is unbiased at the cost of heavy computation (performed in Java).\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA models can be evaluated based on several different metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Perplexity** is a [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity) of 'surprise', or how well the model predicts.  The lower the score, the better the prediction.\n",
    "- **Coherence** is the degree of 'semantic similarity between high scoring keywords in the topic' [Learn to Find Topics in a Text Corpus](https://towardsdatascience.com/evaluate-topic-model-in-python-latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-7d57484bb5d0).  It is computed as a the sum of pairwise scores of the top n words by frequency.  The higher the coherence, the more coherent and interpretable the topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the number of topics in an LDA model can be an arbitrary decision. We inform this decision through hyperparameter tuning based on an evaluation of the topic coherence yielded by different numbers of topics.  \n",
